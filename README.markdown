# Russforth

Russforth is a teeny-tiny Forth implementation in Ruby.

It currently supports the following:

 - Shuffling operators: `drop`, `dup`, `swap`, `rot`, `over`, `qdup`
 - Mathematical operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `min`, `max`
 - Stack operators: `.`
 - I/O: `cr`, `.S`
 
In addition, Russforth allows user defined words via the `:` operator.

More to come.
